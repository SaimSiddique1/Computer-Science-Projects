Silent Hill 2 Remake
Hero Name: James
You start with a shotgun!

Desolate Street
The road stretches ahead, cracked and weathered, with weeds pushing through the asphalt. On either side, towering rusted fences line the path, their jagged edges entangled with remnants of barbed wire. The sky above is a dull, oppressive gray, casting long shadows across the desolate landscape. The only break in this grim enclosure is a single, narrow exit to the east—an ominous gap in the fence, leading to an unknown fate beyond the horizon. Dust swirls in the air, and silence hangs heavy, as if the world itself is holding its breath.
Possible Exits: E
A monster that looks like two fashion dummies stitched together, consisting of two pairs of legs stands here.

Gas Station
The road is deserted, flanked by crumbling buildings and the skeletal remains of a long-abandoned gas station. Its once-bright sign now hangs crooked, barely legible, while the pumps are rusted, and the windows shattered, leaving dark, empty holes. The air smells faintly of decay and gasoline, lingering from a time long past. Debris litters the cracked pavement, and the silence is broken only by the occasional gust of wind. The only way out is a narrow opening in a rusted fence to the west, offering a bleak escape into the unknown beyond the wasteland.
Possible Exits: W
A large grotesque cockroach is here.
